Unified JavaScript environment for first-class web clients. Make "single-page" webapps a thing of the past.

### One JavaScript/HTML/CSS codebase
Client code runs on the server first to render the initial page, then runs in the browser automatically.
One set of routes, one set of templates, one framework.

### Your web app is finally a normal API client
No more special-cased webapp bootstrap code; use the same exact HTTP API as your native mobile apps right here on the web.

### Render real web pages on the server
Return fully-formed HTML from the server side using the same templates and partials you use in the browser.
SEO is no additional work: The server renders the same markup  as the client.

### Automatic static resource management
Deploy versioned static resources to a third-party in production without having to think about it.
